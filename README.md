# Otak

Otak is a project that I created in 3 weeks as part of the Insight Data Science fellowship. It combines the patterns of what readers say they like (collaborative filtering) with information about the contents of books in the form of reader-generated tags. It does this using matrix factorization, implemented with LightFM. It was created using the Goodbooks-10k data set.

Otaks are creatures from Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books. Le Guin died on Jan. 22nd, 2018, after 88 years and dozens of books. Her work has made me laugh and cry, and I very much like the idea of naming my book recommender in honor of her. I promise that the recommender itself does not unfairly bias its recommendations towards her books ; )
